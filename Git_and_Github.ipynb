A repository has commits to the project or a set of references to the commits called heads. All this information is stored in the same folder as the project in a sub-folder called .git and will mostly be hidden by default in most systems.\n"

Commits must be made to a project to tell git that you’re satisfied with the changes you’ve made and want to commit the changes into the main branch called master by default.\n",

        "- **Date:** Displays the date and time when the commit was made.\n",

        "- **Troubleshooting and Debugging:**\n",
        "    - When issues arise, **`git log`** helps identify when a bug or regression was introduced. You can trace back through the commit history to find the specific change causing the problem.\n",

        "- **Code Reviews:**\n",
        "    - When reviewing code changes, **`git log`** helps reviewers understand the context of the changes. The commit messages provide insights into the rationale behind each modification."
